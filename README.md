# AAC-Redux

Despite @AndroGeek974's heroic attempts to create a Python3 based GUI Android Compilation
Wizard and my contributions, it just didn't work.

This repository is my and @faddat's attempt to do what @AndroGeek974 couldn't
accomplish.


HOW TO USE

The script is relatively easy to use since it has a GUI, but here's what'll still need to be done.

1. Place the AAC-Redux.py file in the home directory of your UBUNTU PC (Yes, we only support Ubuntu for now.)
2. Open a terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T) and type python3 AAC-Redux.py
 

Dependencies

The script only requires python3 be installed on your system, using this 

                                sudo apt-get install python3
